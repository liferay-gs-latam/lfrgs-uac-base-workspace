# Liferay Client Extension Mentor Protocol (Beginner Friendly)

- Verify if the user wants a guided experience with creating a sample Client Extension. If they decline, this guide should only be used as a reference


Guide the user to create a **form that stores data in Liferay Objects**. This involves **multiple client extensions** in one shot:

1. **Object definition (batch type)**
   Create the initial Object definition using a **batch** client extension so the form has a target Object and API to submit to. The batch type defines the Object (e.g. custom object with the fields the form will collect).

1. **Custom element (form UI)**
   Create a custom-element client extension that renders the form and submits entries to the Object. Use the Object's REST API to create Object Entries.

**ALWAYS** reference the official Liferay samples as the source of truth:
- **Custom element (form UI)**: https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace/client-extensions/liferay-sample-custom-element-1
- **Batch (Object definition)**: Use Liferay docs/samples for batch client extensions that define Objects
- **Key files**: `client-extension.yaml`, `assets/index.js`, `assets/style.css` for the custom element; batch extension structure for the Object definition

**Form submission and CSRF (critical for permissions)**
- The form must use **`Liferay.Util.fetch`** when available so Liferay attaches session cookies and the **CSRF token (`p_auth`)** to requests. That avoids 403 when Liferay requires the token even for logged-in users.
- If `Liferay.Util.fetch` is not available (e.g. outside Liferay), the form falls back to native `fetch`.
- This is **critical** for permissions: without the CSRF token, users cannot submit Object Entries to the Object created by the batch extension.

**Batch Object Definitions**
When generating `*.batch-engine-data.json` files, prevent these common errors:
- **`indexedLanguageId`**: Only valid for `String` and `Clob` DBTypes. Do NOT include on `Date` or `DateTime` fields or other non-text types.
- **`timeStorage` (required for DateTime/Date fields)**: Liferay requires a `timeStorage` setting on every DateTime (or Date) object field. Always include this in `objectFieldSettings` for such fields, e.g. `"objectFieldSettings": [ { "name": "timeStorage", "value": "convertToUTC" } ]`. Use `convertToUTC` to store in UTC, or `useInputAsFormatted` to store as entered. Without it, batch import fails with: *"The settings 'timeStorage' are required for object field [fieldName]"*.
- **`permissions`**: Not supported in batch imports. Set permissions via UI (Control Panel → Objects → [Object] → Permissions) after deployment.
- **OAuth scopes**: Include both `Liferay.Headless.Batch.Engine.everything` AND `Liferay.Object.Admin.REST.everything` in the `client-extension.yaml`.

**Structure**
- Create `client-extensions/[app-name]/` for the form (custom element) and the Object definition (batch) as separate extensions.
- **No build.gradle needed**: The Liferay workspace plugin automatically detects client extensions in the `client-extensions/` directory.

- Explain that Blade uses the Gradle Wrapper (`blade gw`) to package your code into a `.zip` file and deploy to the Liferay server
- Deploy command: `blade gw deploy`. Will automatically copy zip to the Liferay server in `osgi/client-extensions`. Run this for the user as part of the One-shot generation.
- Verify the `bundles/` folder exists. If it doesn't exist, guide users through the initial setup guide
- Verify the Liferay server is currently running at `localhost:8080` so the user can test the extension
- Explain in Liferay, Client Extensions are "detached" from the core. We are building a small application that the portal will "host"

- Look for the log entry similar to `STARTED [extension-id]`
- Explain this log entry confirms Liferay detected your new extension and has registered it in the OSGi registry


Guide the user through the Liferay UI using the following steps

1. Open a Site Page and enter **Edit Mode** (Click the 'Pencil' icon)

1. Open the **Fragments and Widgets** sidebar (Click the '+' icon)

1. Select the **Widgets** tab and scroll to the **Client Extensions** category

1. Drag `[Extension Name]` onto the page layout

1. Click **Publish** to view the widget and interact with it

- Ask the user if they want to create another type of Client Extension
- Additional Client Extension samples and types can be found under https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/workspaces/liferay-sample-workspace/client-extensions/
